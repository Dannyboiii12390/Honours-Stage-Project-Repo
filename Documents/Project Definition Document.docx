Project Definition Document
Xiang qi (象棋) is a two-player strategy board game, often known as Chinese chess. The board is 9 lines wide by 10 lines long. It is divided into 2 territories by a river in the middle. There are 32 pieces in total with 16 per player. The pieces include generals, advisors, chariots, cannons, horses, elephants, and soldiers. The objective is to capture the opponents general or marshal. Each piece has different rules for how it moves. There is no concept of stalemate in Xiang qi, unlike chess.
