Project Definition Document
Xiang qi (象棋) is a two-player strategy board game, often known as Chinese chess. The board is 9 lines wide by 10 lines long. It is divided into 2 territories by a river in the middle. There are 32 pieces in total with 16 per player. The pieces include generals, advisors, chariots, cannons, horses, elephants, and soldiers. The objective is to capture the opponents general or marshal. Each piece has different rules for how it moves. There is no concept of stalemate in Xiang qi, unlike chess.

Why is the project being undertaken?
This project Is being undertaken for a multitude of reasons. One reason is skill development. Many games, chess and Xiang qi included, are designed to challenge player and help them develop various skills, such as problem-solving and strategic thinking. Social Interaction. Multiplayer games allow people to connect and play with friends or meet new people from around the world. This project will include a multiplayer element, Where 2 players can play against each other. Games like chess and Xiang qi promote competition, for some the competitive aspect of games is very appealing. Whether its competing against other or trying to beat personal bests, the challenge can be highly motivating. Playing games, especially board games can be a way to unwind and de-stress after a long day. The immersive nature of games can help players take their minds off their worries and relax.

Rationale? – why is it worth doing
To who?

What will the project deliver?
The project will be a website. That will allow everyone to use the game, it will also allow people to easily play against each other. And mainly, so that everyone can play the game whenever they want to, wherever they want to.

Primary Objectives
Objective
How will these be Complete
A website anyone can visit

A functioning game

A way for anyone to join search for a game

Secondary Objectives
Objective
How will these be complete
A button explaining all the rules / How the pieces move 

An AI for the players to play against

Cross-Platform Compatibility



What is the scope of the project?
How will the success of the project as a whole be judged?
Appropriate programme competency?

How will the project be delivered?
Agile has multiple benefits. It allows for iterative development, meaning adjustments based on feedback and changing requirements without derailing the entire project. Its iterative cycles, enable the delivery of functional parts of the game more quickly, allowing for early testing and feedback. This results in improved quality continuous integration and deployment results in a more stable and polished product.
However, when the requirements are clearly outlined well documented and unlikely to change, as this project is, the waterfall approach can be more efficient. The simplicity and controlled nature of waterfall makes it easier to manage and control, especially when working in small teams, such as just myself. It also provides a structured and sequential process, which can lead to more predictable outcome and easier project management. Which when working on a project with a strict deadline makes waterfall a better approach.
As this game will be a website, it forces me to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However tools such as Typescript and react will also be used, as this will speed up the development process
How will these be managed?
How will results be evaluated and used?
At the end of the project how will I assess whether the methodology and tools were appropriate and successful?

What is the timescale for the project?
Clear End date, but how will I use the time I have available?
Major tasks?
And how to they depend on each other?
How will I divide my time?

What are the risks and constraints that might affect the completion of my project?
Any factors which could cause the project to fail?
What can I do to avoid them or deal with the consequences?
Any parts I know are going to be difficult?
Do you have free rein over the technologies and techniques you can employ?
Constraints which mean you must use specific things?

What are the ethical issues?
Ethical concerns in developing and conducting the project?
Legal considerations (GDPR)?
(PDD doesn’t need to consider ethical issues resulting from the implementation of the project after is is complete)

What are the commercial factors of the project?
How much will it cost? 
How could it be commercially exploited?
What is the market for it? 
Is there any competition?

How will the project be evaluated?
Criteria? (numerical)
Methods by which it will be judged?
(Effectively writing the exam questions before you take the test)
