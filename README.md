Xiangqi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi) also known as Chinese chess is a kind of two-player antagonistic game originated in China. Since the rules are simple and interesting, it has become a very popular chess game. The game represents a battle between two armies, with the primary object being to checkmate the enemy's general (king). 

Xiangqi uses a square grid board and two-color (red and black) round pieces to play games. There are ten horizontal lines and nine vertical lines on the board, which divides the board into 90 intersections. There are 32 pieces in Xiangqi, 16 pieces of each color, which is divided into 7 different arms. The two sides play chess alternately, and the one who checkmates the opponent's general (king) first wins. 

Distinctive features of xiangqi include the cannon (pao), which must jump to capture; a rule prohibiting the generals from facing each other directly; areas on the board called the river and palace which restrict the movement of some pieces but enhance that of others; and the placement of the pieces on the intersections of the board lines, rather than within the squares. 

This project aims to develop a Xiangqi game. The game should conform to the traditional Xiangqi rules and logic. In addition, this project can also expand its function with some practical auxiliary functions, such as rollback, reminder of available steps, exchange side and reset game. The game should also have some online playing capabilities so that two players can play the game via network. Bonus: We encourage students to further consider applying some suitable artificial intelligence algorithms to this project to improve the game so that a human-machine game become feasible. This requires more academic research and reconsideration of the game's architectural design. It is worth noting that the program logic of Xiangqi is quite complicated. Each type of chess piece has its own rules for moving and catching pieces. 

All kinds of chess games are ever-changing. Without a clear idea and a reasonable structure, your development will fall into a nightmare of logical confusion. There is a challenge to understand the rules and some simple Chinese characters. A similar online Xiangqi game is shown here http://xahlee.info/chinese_chess/chinese_chess.html.
